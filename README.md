## Imbalanced-learn: A scikit-learn-contrib to tackle learning from imbalanced data set

*Abstract*: The curse of imbalanced data set refers to data sets in which the
number of samples in one class is less than in others. This issue is often
encountered in real world data sets such as medical imaging applications
(e.g. cancer detection), fraud detection, etc. In such particular condition,
machine learning algorithms learn sub-optimal models which will generally favor
the class having the largest number of samples. In this talk, we review the
different available strategy to learn a statistical model under those specific
condition. Then, we will present `imbalanced-learn` package and the new
features which will be released in the new version 0.4.

# CDS Pitching Day 2017

## RAMP on predicting autism from resting-state functional MRI and anatomical MRI

*Abstract*: This talk will present the ongoing preparation of a RAMP aiming at
distinguishing subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from typical
control subjects. This analysis will use the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE I & II) database and data from Robert Debre Hospital based on R-fMRI and
anatomical MRI. We will particularly focus on presenting the problematic, the
typical pipeline answering this problem, and the current status of this RAMP.
This work is in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute (Neuroanatomy group of
the Unit of Human Genetics and Cognitive Functions).

# PyParis 2017

## Leverage knowledge from under-represented classes in machine learning: an introduction to imbalanced-learn

*Abstract*: The curse of imbalanced data set refers to data sets in which the
number of samples in one class is less than in others. This issue is often
encountered in real world data sets such as medical imaging applications
(e.g. cancer detection), fraud detection, etc. In such particular condition,
machine learning algorithms learn sub-optimal models which will generally favor
the class having the largest number of samples. In this talk, we will present
the imbalanced-learn package which implement some of the state-of-the-art
algorithms, tackling the class imbalance problem.
