## Leverage knowledge from under-represented classes in machine learning: an introduction to imbalanced-learn

*Abstract*: The curse of imbalanced data set refers to data sets in which the
number of samples in one class is less than in others. This issue is often
encountered in real world data sets such as medical imaging applications
(e.g. cancer detection), fraud detection, etc. In such particular condition,
machine learning algorithms learn sub-optimal models which will generally favor
the class having the largest number of samples. In this talk, we will present
the imbalanced-learn package which implement some of the state-of-the-art
algorithms, tackling the class imbalance problem.
